# twitter language analysis using functions with variable-length arguments

 Our goal is to perform a simple generalized Twitter language analysis on dataset tweets.csv available from the web. The user can pass as many column names as the user would like and the output will be a dictionary that has the languages as keys and the occurrences of tweets in certain languages, source of those tweets etc. as values.
